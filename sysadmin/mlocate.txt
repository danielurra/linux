How to install "locate" on CentOS 7
"yum install mlocate"
After installing mlocate, you need to update the updatedb.
"sudo updatedb"
See example below piping a long output to "wc" for counting the amount of lines "-l":
[root@centos7 ~]# locate passwd | wc -l
115
[root@centos7 ~]#
Now you can pipe the output to grep to select only line wich contain the word "passwd"
[root@centos7 ~]# locate passwd | grep "passwd$"
/etc/passwd
/etc/pam.d/passwd
/etc/security/opasswd
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/htpasswd
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/sbin/chpasswd
/usr/sbin/lpasswd
[root@centos7 ~]# 
As you can see we do have a few false positves (those starting with other letters like "opasswd" or "gpasswd")
and we need to tweak our filter a little bit more:
[root@centos7 ~]# locate passwd | grep "/passwd$"
/etc/passwd
/etc/pam.d/passwd
/usr/bin/passwd
[root@centos7 ~]# 
Let's add a second pipe to our already well modified output, let's use "cat -n" to see each line whit its "line number":
[root@centos7 ~]# locate passwd | grep "/passwd$" | cat -n
     1  /etc/passwd
     2  /etc/pam.d/passwd
     3  /usr/bin/passwd
[root@centos7 ~]#
