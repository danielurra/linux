# Linux
It has been a while since the times when I was learning Linux<br>
And that's the reason why I decided to review a few important concepts<br>
and also to get up to date on current trends in the sysadmin field<br>
Most of the time I work with CentOS<br>
## Locate<br>

## Grep<br>
Grep is a tool used to search for certain expressions in data <br>
these expressions can be plain text or those known as Regular Expressions <br>
And the input for this command could be either an existent file or the output <br>
coming from another command (redirecting using pipe) <br>
See below an example of using "grep" to find and highlight the word "bin" inside the <br>
file "passwd" that is located inside the directory "/etc":<br>

## Terminal Emulator<br>
By the way for those of you wondering about the terminal emulator I prefer<br>
and which color scheme was selected, see below screenshot (SecureCRT)<br>
